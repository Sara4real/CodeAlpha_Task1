# 🌸 Task 1 – Iris Flower Classification | CodeAlpha Data Science Internship

This project is a part of my CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. It involves building a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on petal and sepal features.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Iris.csv
- Features: 
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target: 
  - Species of Iris Flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Machine Learning Steps

1. Data loading & exploration
2. Feature-target separation
3. Data visualization (pairplot, heatmap)
4. Model training using:
   - ✅ Random Forest Classifier
   - ✅ Logistic Regression (for comparison)
5. Model evaluation (accuracy score & confusion matrix)

---

## ✅ Results
- Best Model: **Random Forest**
- Accuracy: **~97%**
- Confusion matrix shows high precision for all three classes

---

## 📊 Visuals
- 📌 Correlation Heatmap
- 🌼 Pairplot of features colored by species
- 📉 Model accuracy comparison

---

## 💡 Learnings
- How to preprocess and visualize real-world data
- Importance of model evaluation
- Hands-on experience in training classification models
